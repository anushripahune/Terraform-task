Task Completion Report: Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Terraform

1. Choose Cloud Provider:

a. Select a AWS cloud provider for the infrastructure deployment.
b. Set up an account and obtain necessary credentials (access keys, secret keys) for
Terraform.

2. Define Terraform Configuration:

a. Install Terraform on your local machine or a designated server.
b. Create a Terraform configuration file (main.tf) to define the cloud infrastructure resources
(e.g., virtual machines, load balancers, databases, networking components) required for the
web application.

3. Configure Terraform Variables:

a. Use Terraform variables to parameterize your configuration and make it reusable across
environments.
b. Define variables for cloud region, instance types, network settings, security groups, and
other resource attributes.

4. Provision Infrastructure:

a. Initialize the Terraform configuration using the

'terraform init'

command.

b. Plan the infrastructure changes using

'terraform plan

' to preview the resources that will be

created, modified, or destroyed.
c. Apply the Terraform configuration using

'terraform apply

' to provision the cloud resources

based on your defined configuration.

5. Manage Infrastructure State:

a. Store and manage Terraform state files securely (e.g., using remote state storage in AWS
S3, Azure Blob Storage, or HashiCorp Terraform Cloud).
b. Use Terraform workspace management for multiple environments (dev, test, prod) and
version control with Git.

6. Validate Deployment:

a. Access the provisioned cloud resources through the cloud provider
'

s console or command-
